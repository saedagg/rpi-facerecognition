# Raspberry Pi OpenCV Face Recognition
Raspberry Pi face recognition written in C++ using the OpenCV libraries.
Can be used with the ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to display the distance to an object.
Use in conjunction with MJPG streamer to output to a web page.
Makes use of mutithreading (C++11 standard) to asynchronously call the face detection function.
